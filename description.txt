The description of the functions are described in libsys.c file where every function represents an activity of a real library.
libsys.h contains all the definition of the status values, structures and error codes that are used for better understanding.
simple_driver.c is a testing file that gives several inputs and expects some outputs in order to check if libsys.c functions well.
To compile, use 'gcc libsys.c simple_driver.c -o a.out' command.
The output produced by the simple_driver.c file should be similar to output.pdf.
